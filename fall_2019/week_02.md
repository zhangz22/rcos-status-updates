1. We looked through Java's Calendar class and several online time-related classes,
and found based on the need for our program, it would be better if we wrote our own
version for many reasons. For example, our program needs the class to be only accurate
to second instead of millisecond.
2. We wrote a CalendarWrapper class to modify java.util.Calendar
3. We wrote test cases for CalendarWrapper
4. We started with a Deadline class
