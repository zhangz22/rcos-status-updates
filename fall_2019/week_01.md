## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

- Last week, our team made a draft on the program structure and a draft of the class diagram.
- We created a github repo for our project, which can be found at https://github.com/zhangz22/DeadlineCountdown
- We finished our project proposal
- We created milestones based on our proposal
- We analyzed our goals:
	- Our application should meet the need of students to view deadlines in a more compact way and to manage deadlines efficiently and to avoid wasting time on clicking into specific course webpages and reading boring text deadline informations. 
	- Our product should be able to integrate deadline information from different web pages and display them on a calendar to help visualize those information. 
- We also analyzed our product risks:
	- This project should allow the feature of using data from a web crawler to make data acquisition easier. Such crawler could potentially be prohibited or be banned by the server.
	- User may be concerned about the security of their account information including their id, their password, their grade information and their source file.
	- The success of a crawler depends on the web page layout, which may be changed unexpectly in the future.
	- The search algorithm may be inefficient
	- Our team members have limited amount of knowledge about GUI interface development
